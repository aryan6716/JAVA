 try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
}
catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Code to handle the exception
}
finally {
    Executes always, no matter if an exception occurs or not

    When does finally not execute? When JVM exits using System.exit(0) or power failure occurs
    Can there be multiple finally blocks? ❌ No, only one per try.
    It is mainly used for cleanup operations (like closing files or releasing memory).

| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| What is the purpose of `try` block?        | To place code that may throw an exception.                  |
| What is `catch` block used for?            | To handle the exception gracefully.                         |
| Is `finally` block mandatory?              | ❌ No, it’s optional.                                        |
| When does `finally` block execute?         | Always — whether exception occurs or not.                   |
| When will `finally` not execute?           | If we use `System.exit(0)` or power failure occurs.         |
| Can we use `try` without `catch`?          | ✅ Yes, but only if we use `finally`.                        |
| Can we have multiple `catch` blocks?       | ✅ Yes, to handle different exceptions.                      |
| Can we have multiple `finally` blocks?     | ❌ No, only one per `try`.                                   |
| What happens if no exception occurs?       | `catch` is skipped, `finally` runs.                         |
| What is the use of `finally` in real life? | To close files, database connections, or release resources. |

            System.out.println("Array Index Out of Bounds Exception handled");

✅ Explanation:
Exception → is the parent class of all exceptions in Java. It’s a subclass of Throwable. catch all types of exceptions. Not recommended — use specific exceptions for clarity.
