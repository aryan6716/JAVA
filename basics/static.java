🧠 What is a Static Block?
A static block runs automatically when your program starts (before main()).
It’s used to initialize static variables.
You only use it with variables marked static.


🧠 What is a Static Variable?
A static variable is a variable that belongs to the class itself, not to objects made from that class.
✅ Think of It Like This:
Imagine a school class.
All students have their own names, roll numbers (these are normal variables).
But the school name is the same for every student (this is a static variable).
